WE WENT ONCE MORE OVER EVERY POINT THEN TRIPLE-CHECKED
BEING PICKED UP FOR QUESTIONING BY A COP ON THE WAY OUT SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY POSSIBLE REMAINING DANGER AND WE WEREN'T PICKED UP BY A COP
IN FACT NOBODY SAW US COP OR CITIZEN
WINSETT IS A QUIET STREET WITH NO TAVERNS AND WAS COMPLETELY DESERTED AT THAT HOUR
WHICH IF IT MATTERS WAS ONE A.M.
LESS THAN THREE HOURS AGO WE'D DECIDED IN MAXINE WELLS'S PAD ON COSMO TO COMMIT A TRIAL MURDER
IT HAD GONE LIKE CLOCKWORK
ALMOST TOO SMOOTHLY I FOUND MYSELF THINKING AND THEN TOLD MYSELF THAT WAS RIDICULOUS
HOW SAFE IS TOO SAFE ? THINKING LIKE THAT CAN GET YOU INTO A PADDED PAD
AN HOUR LATER WE WERE BACK IN MY UNPADDED PAD KILLING WHAT HAD BEEN LEFT OF THE SECOND PINT
WE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE THIRD ONE INTACT FOR TOMORROW
ALSO OUR PLANS FOR ME TO COMMIT CHARLIE'S MURDER AND FOR HIM TO COMMIT MINE
BUT WE WERE REALLY GOING TO DO IT
WE SHOOK HANDS ON IT
WE PLANNED AHEAD ONLY ONE STEP A RENDEZVOUS FOR TOMORROW WHEN WE COULD SWAP NOTES
I'D TELL HIM EVERYTHING I'D LEARNED ABOUT SEATON'S HABITS AND HABITAT AND HE'D TELL ME THE SCORE ON RADIC
WE MADE THE DATE FOR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AT MAXINE WELLS'S PAD
CHARLIE WOULD GET THERE EARLY BECAUSE HE HAD THE KEY
FROM HERE ON IN THE LESS CHARLIE AND I WERE SEEN TOGETHER IN PUBLIC OR VISITED ONE ANOTHER'S ROOMS THE BETTER
I WAS DEAD TIRED AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AS FAR AS I KNOW DREAMLESSLY
WE MET AT MAXINE'S AND DECIDED WE WERE SET TO STAY AS LONG AS IT TOOK INTO OR EVEN THROUGH THE EVENING TO TALK THINGS OUT
CHARLIE HAD BROUGHT FOOD AND WE'D DECIDED ON NO DRINKS
I'D BROUGHT ALONG THE VIRGIN PINT FROM LAST NIGHT BUT WE WERE GOING TO KILL THAT ONLY WHEN WE WERE THROUGH TALKING
I TALKED FIRST TELLING HIM EVERYTHING I KNEW ABOUT SEATON AND HIS HOUSE AND DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
I DREW DIAGRAMS AND FLOOR PLANS ; HE MEMORIZED THEM THOROUGHLY AND THEN WE TORE THEM INTO TINY PIECES AND FLUSHED THEM DOWN
HE GAVE ME EQUIVALENT AND EVEN MORE DETAILED DOPE ON RADIC INCLUDING DIAGRAMS -- ONE OF THE APARTMENT BUILDING RADIC LIVED IN AND ONE OF THE APARTMENT ITSELF
HE'D BEEN THERE SEVERAL TIMES BACK WHEN WHILE HE AND RADIC HAD BEEN FRIENDS OR AT LEAST NOT ENEMIES
IT DIDN'T TAKE US AS LONG AS WE'D THOUGHT IT MIGHT ; IT WAS NOT QUITE SIX O'CLOCK WHEN WE FINISHED AND CHARLIE SAID WELL I GUESS THAT'S IT
SHALL WE FLIP A COIN TO SEE WHICH OF US GOES FIRST ? OR WOULD YOU RATHER DEAL A HAND OF SHOW-DOWN POKER OR PLAY A GAME OF GIN RUMMY OR WHAT ?
ONE THING WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED EXPENSE MONEY
WE'LL NEED SOME AT LEAST IF ONLY BUS FARE TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
AND IF YOU'RE AS FLAT BROKE AS I AM I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE THE ADDED RISK OF KNOCKING OVER A FILLING STATION OR SOMETHING BEFORE WE SPLIT FOR ONE OF US
HE SIGHED
ALL RIGHT I'LL COME CLEAN
I'VE GOT A LITTLE STASHED FOR A RAINY DAY AND I GUESS THIS IS RAINY ENOUGH
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED
IF YOU DRAW THE SHORT STRAW I'LL LEND YOU SOME BREAD LIKE FIFTY BUCKS BEFORE I TAKE OFF TO VISIT MY SISTER IN FRISCO
THEN AFTER I'M BACK ANOTHER FIFTY SO YOU CAN PUT SOME MILEAGE ON YOURSELF AND HAVE A SOLID ALIBI SOMEWHERE WHILE I TAKE CARE OF YOUR SEAT COVER BOY
SOLID I SAID
I TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND THE PLUNGE
IN THAT CASE LET'S NOT DRAW
I'LL GO TO BAT FIRST
YOU'D HAVE TO WAIT TILL SEATON'S BACK FROM MEXICO CITY AND ALSO WHILE I SET IT UP WITH DORIS TO HAVE HER HAVE AN ALIBI FOR D-NIGHT
SO IT WOULDN'T BE FOR DAYS OR EVEN A WEEK BEFORE YOU COULD DO ANYTHING
BUT YOUR FRIEND MANNY CAN GO ANY TIME
HE GRINNED AND CLAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER
I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT WILLY
BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE SUGGESTED IT
WELL -- IN THAT CASE I TAKE OFF TOMORROW MORNING FOR FRISCO
AND IN CASE I BROUGHT THE MONEY WITH ME
