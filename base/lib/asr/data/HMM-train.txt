HAVE DROPPED THE CASE
I WANT YOU TO GO TO PEARSON CITY AND FIND OUT WHY -- FIRST-HAND STUFF FOR YOUR MODERN CRIME SERIES
TAKE THE SAME TRAIN DIANA BEAUCLERK TOOK AND GET THERE AT THE SAME TIME
GO TO THE SAME HOTEL AND OCCUPY THE SAME SUITE -- 1105
WILL THE HOTEL RENT IT SO SOON AFTER THE CRIME ? WHY NOT ? THE POLICE HAVE FINISHED WITH IT
BESIDES THE NUMBER OF THE SUITE HASN'T BEEN PUBLISHED IN ANY NEWSPAPER
TO THE HOTEL PEOPLE YOU'LL JUST BE AN INNOCENT TOURIST WHO HAPPENS TO ASK FOR THAT PARTICULAR SUITE
STILL THEY MAY NOT WANT TO RENT IT
THAT'S YOUR HEADACHE
ONCE INSIDE KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN  FOR WHAT  ALEC WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE SKEPTICAL
THE POLICE WILL HAVE GONE OVER EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THE PLACE WITH A FINE-TOOTH COMB
THE HOTEL PEOPLE WILL HAVE SCOURED AND VACUUMED IT
TEN TO ONE IT'S EVEN BEEN REDECORATED  THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE THEY MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED SOMETHING RETURNED THE CHIEF
I'M BETTING ON THAT CHANCE
INTERVIEW THE BELLBOY AND CHAMBERMAID WHO WAITED ON BEAUCLERK
STUDY THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE SUITE
SOAK UP LOCAL COLOR
REENACT EVERYTHING BEAUCLERK DID
TRY TO IMAGINE YOU'RE GOING TO BE MURDERED YOURSELF -- BETWEEN ELEVEN P.M. AND ONE A.M. THE NIGHT YOU ARRIVE
ALEC SMIRKED
CHEERFUL WAY TO SPEND AN EVENING  A SUDDEN THOUGHT WIPED THE SMIRK FROM HIS FACE
SUPPOSE THE MURDERER SHOULD RETURN TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME  THE CHIEF'S EYES GLEAMED
HE SPOKE SOFTLY
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M HOPING FOR
AFTER ALL THE MURDERER IS STILL AT LARGE
AND THE KEY TO THE SUITE IS STILL MISSING
ON THE TRAIN ALEC REFRESHED HIS MEMORY OF THE BEAUCLERK CASE BY READING TELETYPE FLIMSIES -- SPOT-NEWS STORIES ABOUT THE CRIME SENT OUT BY THE PEARSON CITY STAR A MEMBER OF THE SYNDICATE
DIANA BEAUCLERK WAS A SECOND-RATE ACTRESS LIVING IN NEW YORK
TWO WEEKS AGO SHE HAD GONE WEST TO PEARSON CITY
DANIEL FORBES HER DIVORCED HUSBAND LIVED THERE
SO DID THE FIRM OF LAWYERS WHO HAD GOT HER THE DIVORCE KIMBALL AND STACY
SHE REACHED PEARSON CITY AT NINE P.M. AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HOTEL WESTMORE
SHE TELEPHONED THE JUNIOR PARTNER OF HER LAW FIRM MARTIN STACY AND ASKED HIM TO CALL AT HER HOTEL THAT EVENING
AT THE TIME OF HER DIVORCE FORBES HAD PROMISED TO PAY HER A LUMP SUM IN LIEU OF FURTHER ALIMONY IF SHE REMARRIED
ACCORDING TO STACY SHE TOLD HIM SHE WAS PLANNING TO REMARRY AND SHE WANTED HIM TO ASK FORBES FOR THE LUMP SUM
STACY REPLIED THAT IT WOULD BANKRUPT FORBES WHO HAD JUST SUNK ALL HIS MONEY IN A REAL ESTATE VENTURE
STACY SAID HE LEFT HER SUITE AT NINE FORTY-FIVE P.M.
SHE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH AND SPIRITS BUT STILL DETERMINED TO GET THE MONEY FROM FORBES
NO ONE SAW STACY LEAVE
NO OTHER VISITOR INQUIRED FOR HER THAT EVENING
NEXT MORNING SHE WAS FOUND DEAD IN HER SUITE WITH A BULLET FROM A .22-CALIBER COLT REVOLVER IN HER BRAIN
ACCORDING TO THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SHE WAS SHOT BETWEEN ELEVEN P.M. AND ONE A.M.
HER DOOR WAS LOCKED AND THE KEY WAS MISSING
SO WAS THE GUN
WHEN ALEC FINISHED READING HE WAS SURE THAT EITHER FORBES OR STACY HAD KILLED DIANA BEAUCLERK
FORBES HAD MOTIVE AND STACY HAD OPPORTUNITY
FIND A MOTIVE FOR STACY OR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FORBES AND THE CASE WOULD BE SOLVED
THE HOTEL WESTMORE PROVED TO BE ONE OF THE OLDER HOTELS IN PEARSON CITY AND DEFINITELY SECOND-RATE
ALEC'S FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE LOBBY WAS GLOOMY VICTORIAN DIGNITY -- BLACK WALNUT AND RED PLUSH A BLACK AND WHITE TILED FLOOR AND PERSIAN RUGS
HE STUDIED THE NIGHT CLERK AS A MAN MEASURES AN ADVERSARY
SOMETHING HARD GRAZED HIS KNUCKLES
